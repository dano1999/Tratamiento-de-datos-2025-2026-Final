1022,is it true google still hasn't profited from youtube after 10 years? and if so why do they even still own youtube why run a website that doesn't even make you money also how could they not profit when they sell ads etc?,"Google's spin-off benefits from owning YouTube include the accumulation of our data and strengthening of their network design -- and the more time people spend watching online video, the more advertisers will pour into marketing on the internet as a whole. There's no doubt that Google can afford YouTube."" 

 McMahon also believes that by keeping quiet about YouTube's hidden benefits and by allowing the misconception of it as a deeply unprofitable business to circulate, things work very nicely in Google's favour when it comes to negotiating with copyright holders in the world of TV, movies and music. Copyright holders can't demand money that isn't there, and it would certainly take no more than a hint of profitability at YouTube for lawyers to descend, threatening court cases and demanding higher royalties. In the new, topsy-turvy world of online economics, it seems astonishing that losses on paper have actually made YouTube a more powerful online force. This leaves out another point as well: the more that people believe YouTube is unprofitable, the less likely they are to build serious competitors. I have no idea whether or not YouTube is actually profitable directly yet (I'd doubt it), but I think those who are insisting that the acquisition by Google was a bad idea, or that YouTube is somehow on its deathbed, haven't taken much time to understand some basic trendlines or the larger picture of how Google views YouTube, and the opportunities it has to make money via YouTube down the road.",comment

Visitations, maybe, though I'd call even that unlikely before relatively modern times, and they'd have to leave much more spare traces, and in nearly all cases and evidence would have been destroyed long ago by the very harsh conditions there.

What *is* true, however, is that 'lost' Antarctic expeditions of the much more recent path -- we're talking more like a century ago -- *have* been sometimes found there, including fairly recently. Because just getting there is such an enormous undertaking, we at least know that they *went* there, even if we don't know what became of them. There haven't been many such expeditions, however, so it's not like there are numerous lost artefacts to be found. Maybe half a dozen at most not already located.

1085,Debunk this: 32 companies dodged $72 billion in 2012,"Yep and education spending is closer to $900 billion (in the [2004-05 school year](http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/index.html?exp=3) K-12 received $536 billion in funding and higher education received $373 billion in funding).

The Department of Education is a pretty minor contributor to education spending overall.

Corporations dodging taxes is a problem, of course, which is why Obama is proposing corporate tax reform which would include lowering the tax rate to something closer to the effective tax rate and closing a lot of loopholes (which would make it simpler while maintaining revenue).",comment

 Even on Fox News own term of use it states the information on its website is used for the viewers enjoyment and entertainment. And Ailes the former CEO had even stated in an interview that he did not view CNN and NBC as competitors but ESPN and TNT. Doesnt prove anything but interesting to compare yourself to entertainment networks and still claim to be a news network.

1213,Great Pyramid of Giza can focus electromagnetic energy through its hidden chambers,"I went just after the revolution. 

Cairo was in a bit of disarray. Infrastructure was mostly shut down. There were no working taffic lights in the city.  Roads were jammed, but everyone went with the flow. It was cool.

Hired a personal guide for my wife and me. Surprisingly affordable. 

When we got off the plane, we got in a very long line for customs.

Our hotel, Marriott, had sent a...greeter...to ease the process.

He introduced himself, told us to follow him. Strode to an empty customs booth and slapped the counter hard.  A customs person came over and told him (I assume) that the lane was closed.  He gestured at us and said, ""Americans.""

The clerk smiled big and immediately processed us.  I felt funny about that. Not my style to jump line, but everyone, including the folks in line smiled warmly at us.

Limo took us to the hotel. Guards we AKs waved at us.

Got checked in. Hungry, went down to The Harry pub in the lobby.  Pics of Dirty Harry, Potter, etc decorated the walls.  Place was empty. One guy behind the bar.

We ordered drinks. Asked for menus. Service was slow, but that was ok.

As we were leaving we found out that the pub wasn't open and it was that fellows day off. But, he never mentioned it. Just gave us friendly service. Even had to make the run to a restaurant in the lobby to get our food. I felt awful. Tipped big.

Our guide told most places that we went that we were Canadian. Said if he told them we were American they woukd have sent an armed guard with us everywhere.

He said it was very safe, but when it comes to Americans they don't take chances.

He drove us all over the country that week.

The days lasted so long - he would take us everywhere and give detailed history about everything. Finally we would get tired and ask to go back to the hotel.

Swelled with pride when he said that the beloved Anwar Sadat and American President Jimmy Carter were best friends. 

Even asked us to come to his home for dinner to meet his family.

He had an apartment on the 5th floor with a perfect view of the pyramids.

The feast he laid out defies description. Just so much food.

Can't say enough good things about the place and the people.  I wasn't accustomed to that kind of treatment.  We did our best to be polite and respectful.",comment

They don't care for talk about aliens, slave labor...stuff like that.  They present the history without any of the conspiracy/odd stuff.

How on Earth ancient peoples obtained flatness on stone finer than 2/10,000ths of an inch is certainly something that leaves me scratching my head.

If that's how low the bar is then just remove every name. I'm sympathetic to elements of these campaigns but this example is just absurd. There's always an element who push something to the Nth degree, which allow opponents to point and them and discredit the whole thing.

There were only two ways to abolish slavery: compensate teh slave owners, or go to war.

The first was cheaper all round in terms of money and lives (including the lives of slaves).

The alternative was not to bother at all, and you could argue that if the British Empire had not abolished slavery, no-one would, because we put massive pressure on the slaving nations once we abolished (both in terms of peer pressure, and in actually capturing ships and releasing slaves). Even with our best efforts places like Brazil didn't abolish slavery till the 1890's.",comment

Also, just because people have said something for a long time doesn't mean they're always going to be wrong. 

For example it might have started dying in 1950, in a process that's going to take 200 years, that will only be properly recognized after 150 years. Whatever anyone has been sobbing for however long before that has zero bearing on whether that's actually the case or not. 

People have been saying the world will end since people have been around, and we know it will one day end, so its pretty ridiculous to suggest that just because people have been incorrectly saying something will happen means that thing won't ever happen.

Malware has been spread across an enormous amount of otherwise large trusted sites and services like the NYT, Spotify, Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, and even across Google's ad network (i.e. half the sites on the internet). It's one of the faster growing attack vectors in recent years.

If you don't run an ad blocker and disable third party domain scripts / frames by default these days, it's increasingly likely you will be (or have already been) exposed to malware. It's exactly like fucking around without a condom, sooner or later you'll get the digital clap.

Many users also never even realise they've been compromised unless the payload is intentionally overt in nature, such as ransomware. Spyware, RATs / trojans, miners and botnet clients only have any benefit to the attacker when they hide their processes from the user.

Sure, going to warez and porn sites obviously increases the risk but there's no such thing as ""safe sites"" to stick to. The vast majority of online businesses who deploy adverts contract it out entirely to agencies who often totally fail to do any serious due diligence on the specific content they are serving up to their clients. And that's the agencies which aren't outright malicious themselves.

The only realistic solution is for more people to buy subs from outlets they want to support, I have several myself. But that's also not feasible for everyone. Just because they can't afford to do so, it doesn't mean they should expose their identities, personal data, and finances to attack.",comment

In a way that's a problem though, because such apathy could easily result in the wholesale hollowing of our connection to the past.

There is a value in keeping things the same. It's not a monetary or ethical value so it's hard to argue for - it's just that there's something fundamentally pleasant, comforting and enriching about having a street name remain the same for hundreds of years. It's not a big value, at least not individually - no-one is experiencing ecstasy from the mere knowledge that that statue in the park has been there for ages and memorialises someone important, but if you add up all the millions of tiny bits of niceness this produces it's actually quite important, I think.

Sometimes there's a good reason to change a name or pull down a statue or make other changes. Actually they happen all the time. But this is a really shit reason, because naming something after someone or having a statue of them doesn't mean you approve of everything they did or believed. Not even remotely. This is such a weird misunderstanding that I find it hard to understand.

But the problem is that it's a seductive argument: so-and-so did something bad, so we shouldn't honour them. And changing this name isn't such a big deal so why not do it? ""Eh"" everybody says, ""I guess that *is* bad, and I guess it *isn't* such a big deal. So who cares?""

Well I think everyone should care because the underlying principle, if carried out consistently, would actually be very bad because of its cumulative effect.",comment

The £4m quoted in the BBC video is only the sum Gladstone's father obtained in slave compensation.      
          
And the student in the video actually underestimates the amount, because [I read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone#Early_life) that £9m is a better estimate of what £106k pounds would buy today:    
     
&gt; Gladstone's father was a slave owner; in 1834, when slavery was abolished, he helped his father obtain £106,769 (equivalent to £83,000,000 relative to average salary, £9,000,000 in purchasing power terms, in 2013):      
         
Gladstone's father was just one of many slave owners that received compensation. In total, [the British government paid £20m in 1833 as compensation to slave owners](https://books.google.be/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), which would be the modern equivalent of between £1.6bn and £1.7bn if one multiplies by 84.

Obama's $114 million was for all of his travel expenses in his entire 8 years in office. Trump's $10 million is for all of his travel expenses *so far* since taking office, which has been just over 10 months. That puts Obama's average per-month travel expenses at $1.18 million and Trump's average per-month travel expenses at $1.0 million.

1604,Trump's Travel Expenses are well behind Obama's pace.,"&gt;  Trump's $10 million is for all of his travel expenses so far since taking office, which has been just over 10 months.

JudicialWatch is reporting on FOIA requests they filed back in July, they haven't released any expenses more recent than June that I can find. So technically, the $10million is only for his first 5 months in office, and we don't have any numbers for the past 5 months yet. He's on track to spend approximately $20million in his first year.

That's also assuming that JW has found all of Trump's spending up through June. Seeing as how they're still receiving FOIA request information on the Obama Family's spending from way back in 2014, I seriously doubt Trump's is complete either.",comment

1633,Debunk this: Six Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America,"I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that 6 companies control 90% of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the 90% figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that 6 companies create and/or distribute a lot of media content. 

There are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it. 

EDIT: Ok, let's explore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me.

&gt; *“Media has never been more consolidated. 6 media giants now control a staggering 90% of what we read, watch or listen to.”*

The most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator (the 6 media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume). In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in 1983 to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in 1983.  

*&gt; ""232 Media executives control the information diet of 277 million Americans""*

Where do these numbers come from?  How does he arrive at 232 media executives? What constitutes ""executive"" or ""control"" or an executive with control? The infographic does not explain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. 


The infographic says the Comcast/NBC merger guarantees ""monopoly of 11 US markets like NYC and Chicago."" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a ""monopoly"" in 11 markets?  

*&gt; ""In 1995, the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than 40 stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over 1,500.""*

In 1996, Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. 

But, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations.

In any event, ""80% of stations' playlists match"" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As exotic as those yankees/southerners/west coasters/midwesterners/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different.  Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country/rap/alternative/jazz/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top 40 mostly like the same bands and songs.  

Radio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting ""burned"" and what songs audiences like (or might like). There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If ""more new music/more variety"" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. 

*&gt; ""The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in 2010, that's 2X the box office sales of the next 140 Studios*""

Wait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants ""control"" the media by owning everything.  But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than ""the next 140 studios"". If there are 146 studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the ""Big 6""....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the ""Big 6"" for distribution. 

And finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: ""Until regulations return (or they buy each other out of existence), they will continue to control 90% of everything Americans see, hear and consider important.""

Sounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the ""media consolidation"" Pollyanna's [were saying 15 years ago](https://transition.fcc.gov/ownership/roundtable_docs/cooper-a.pdf). 

&gt; ""The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media.""

Yeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? 

&gt; ""The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation…. Between March 1999 and March 2001, the total number of companies controlling 50 percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from 11 to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position (over 30 percent of user time) the HHI is about 1200, well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. 

Yes, 15 years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would ""control"" online media.  Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. 

There are big media companies. There always have been. We'll be fine. 

In the meantime, giving government more power over the media will not make things better.

That's speculation on your part, and something that CAN NOT be generalized. Some markets are thriving, some are floundering. Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. Competition and diversity are what make for a healthy market place.

1643,Debunk this: Six Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America,"&gt; That's speculation on your part

It is based on the fact that radio stations are struggling all over the country. There are obviously stations making a great deal of money, especially in large markets, but there are a lot of stations that are barely staying afloat whether they are locally or nationally owned.  In fact, many locally owned stations had to sell to the national chains many years ago because they simply didn't have the resources to compete. 

&gt; Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. 

Yeah, that's how it works no matter who owns the radio stations. ClearChannel, Cumulus, Infinity...they will change the format in a heartbeat if they think the market will better support a different format. 

&gt; Solutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy.

I'm pretty skeptical that the identity of the owner of Hot 104.5 is a critical element in maintaining our democracy. Whether it is owned by ClearChannel or by the local Smith family does not make *that* big a difference in the programming of the radio station. Both of them are trying to maximize profitability and that means adopting whatever research, experts and program directors tell them is most likely to succeed. ",comment

From what I remember though the media, especially print and TV news media, have had arrangements with their 'owners' about what the owners can and can't do. I am pretty sure they can't tell them how to report the news for example. There is a level of non-interference in the contracts when stuff was sold on and usually news group had people in them who continued to work there.

tl;dr, the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating.  It's not linked to cancer the way ionizing radiation is.

Cellphones emit non-ionizing radiation only.  In fact, the radiation emitted by a cellphone is generally between 16cm and 42cm.  Whereas light needs to be at around 200nm to do damage, or around 1 million times more energetic.

They have to be this weak in order to be useful, only visible light and radio waves can punch through the atmosphere.  For comparison, visible light ranges from 750-350nm, and we receive far more of it and radio waves from the sun than from our cellphones.",comment
1656,Cellphone radiation is real. Here are five ways to protect yourself.,"An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'.

Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week?

A number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best.

As for the 5 suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable. Might as well add:

6) Submerge the phone in the center of a swimming pool. Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation.",comment

Because it is somehow understood with that, but not cell phones, microwaves, or tvs, that radiation is the act of giving off a form of energy. the way YOU RADIATE HEAT every day, or lightbulbs RADIATE light upon you. The light is given off and spreads throughout the room.
