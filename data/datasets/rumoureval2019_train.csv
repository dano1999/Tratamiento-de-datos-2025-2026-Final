4228,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of explosions and confusions during war, keep in mind 20% of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ 0 (over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis). Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like ""Brennan’s account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshall’s use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Army
captain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could not
recall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall the
journalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea."" ^1

I would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book / biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life (although later he does kill a German soldier). ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between 25,000 to 100,000 rounds were expended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy (few people want to kill another person).

I also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain.


I apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r/military/ or r/asksocialscience/ .


On a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire.

4229,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","Probably referring to S. L. A. Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places:

&gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average 100 men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only 15 men on average would take any part with the weapons.  This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25% of total strength from the opening to the close of an action.

And

&gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector...

Marshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today.  [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf), and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy.  (Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill.  These weren't firing lines 100 yards apart.  Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone.)

Still, after WWII they led to innovations in training to increase rate of fire.",comment
4230,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the 15%-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted.

For one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only 15-20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an exposed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons (machine guns), and key weapons (flamethrowers).

While his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an exposed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves?

[This](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf) is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war (which came up with a 50% fire rate). Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of.

Simply put... it's just not very good history. It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns, but the 15-20% is more or less impossible to back up, and completely ignores several significant factors.",comment
4231,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall.

I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.

Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that 75% of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.

In fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.

There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.

So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.

If you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.

Engen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.

Canadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!

So - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.

If you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are:

In the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:

4234,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","Don't be ashamed, it's a reasonable point I have overlooked.

Typical modern battles are kinetic, soldiers rarely fight at bayonet distance, they often fight at (50 to 300 meters away)[http://defense-and-freedom.blogspot.com/2009/07/infantry-combat-ranges.html] (even in a stress free environment like a shooting range, it's a bit difficult firing at a target that far away). So even if you're pulling the trigger, it's hard to aim, subconsciously you don't want to kill, so when you fire, you might purposefully... miss slightly.

That was my point. I'm just saying it's probably a bit more likely that it isn't that people don't shoot, but that people do shoot but don't aim.

The Battle of Inkerman would be my favourite example. ",comment
4246,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","This is a great answer. I have read all 3 books you mention, discussed it with professors and veterans. Many people agree that his number is either fabricated or based off a ""gut feeling."" 

What is important about Marshal's work is that it brings to light much more than just the firing rate. There are whole sections on command and training that have been accepted and incorporated into modern training. 

For Grossman, I feel like his point was a bit weak. Basing your work on already shaky research makes it hard to come to a clear and concise point. Linking violent video games to aggressive behaviour is popular and sells copies, but that might just be my biased interpretation of things. Like /u/kombatminipig said, he is very selective in his evidence.

Finally Engen. All I can say is that he is a top notch academic, and *Canadians Against Fire* is a solid piece of work.

4249,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only 15%-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.  I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's experience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight (or not) and the effect that it has on them.  It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true.  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?

The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:

&gt; ""Everyone stop!  OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let’s see if Gruber over there fires at him.""

Almost everything in this area is laced with bias.  Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology.  *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Dixon is a good example: Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One.

Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research.  What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.",comment

There's also the fundamental role that it plays in ""fire and maneuver"" tactics.  One group of soldiers, firing from cover, works to get as much lead flying in the general direction of the opposition in an attempt to hinder their ability to fire on another group of their comrades that are relocating elsewhere.  It's basically meant to be psychological, discouraging the enemy from doing anything more active than taking cover.  ",comment

In general, people do not act rationally when put under sudden and extreme stress, especially if there isn't any stable presence to guide their reactions.  If your commander is telling you to get to bunkers, directing you to positions, and acting like he's still in control of the situation, you're going to have a much better chance of reacting well.

4322,DEBUNK THIS: We could not return to earth after the moon landing because we could not bring enough fuel/rockets to get back.,"You are on the right track. A few additional points : 

* The bulk of the mass (90% or more of total mass!) that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. 
* * See the fuel paradox section of this article https://medium.com/@landingattempts/why-do-rockets-use-so-much-fuel-118486244aba
* As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape (1/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth)
* *  Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth.
* * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper.
* The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without expending further fuel (although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first)
* * This was used for practical effect in Apollo 13 where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to ""turn around"" at the time that the accident happened
* * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian
* During the trip to/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again (absent using the gravity well for that purpose) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you 30 days, or 35 days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost/weight of the fuel to do it in 5 days less is prohibitive). - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out. ",comment
4323,DEBUNK THIS: We could not return to earth after the moon landing because we could not bring enough fuel/rockets to get back.,"Thanks so much for your answer! If you have knowledge of the 'ratio' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon (i.e. get out of the earth's gravity well) vs. the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home, that would be very helpful :)

Thanks for giving me further things to google though!",comment
4324,DEBUNK THIS: We could not return to earth after the moon landing because we could not bring enough fuel/rockets to get back.,"This image gives you quite a bit of the info basically the first and second stages are used entirely to get into earth orbit, and the third stage is for the moon and back : 

S1 : ~500k Gallons
S2 : ~300k G
s3 : ~80k G
 
Probably unaccounted for here is the fuel to lift off from the moon, which was in separate tanks for the lunar module, and would not be that much due to the low gravity of the moon, and the much lower amount of mass being lifted.

As we're talking ""metadata"":

This is outright false and you and me have been over this before. The NSA is permitted to [""Access the **content of communications gathered from ""U.S. based machine[s]"" or phone numbers** in order to establish if targets are located in the US, for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance.""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant)

You are surveiled by default until they decide they're confident you're an American. At that point existing data can be maintained for 5 years and new data can be gathered as long as they're not sure it's you(the person previously identified as a citizen)

Does the DOJ have access to this? Probably not normally. But they do not need a warrant to gather it and the metadata was an outright lie by our government.",comment
4365,"Is it true that if you are not a member of the media, the DOJ no longer needs a warrant to obtain your emails and phone records?","There are two NSA programs – one that gathers U.S. phone records (metadata) and another that is designed  to track the use of U.S.-based Internet servers by foreigners with possible links to terrorism.

You are mixing info on the two in a failed attempt to make a point.

Phone metadata: This includes the “call pairs” — the two phone numbers on a call, plus the date, time and duration of the call.

Email metadata: The “to” and “from” email addresses, along with the IP addresses and subject lines. Basically it’s the same information you’d see on the envelope of a postal letter.

Similar metadata *WAS* collected for text messages, Facebook DMs and the like. The purpose of metadata is to weed out your cat meme emails, which NSA doesn’t care about nor does it read or retain, and to zero in on real suspects for targeted surveillance (which, as you’ll read below, requires an individual warrant for U.S. persons).

What is “minimization?” This is the procedure NSA uses to safeguard the privacy of American citizens. Part of this process includes the anonymization/encryption of personal information, transforming proper names, for example, into random strings of characters called “designators.”

http://thedailybanter.com/2013/07/a-stellar-wind-primer-what-exactly-are-we-talking-about-regarding-the-nsa/

The Washington Post has revised its article. Just one day later, with no acknowledgment except for a 
change in the timestamp, the Post revised the story, 
backing down from sensational claims it made originally. But the damage was already done. 
The article no longer reports that the tech companies gave 
the NSA ""Unrestricted direct access to servers"". 
But, more importantly, the phrase “track a person’s movements and contacts over time” was revised to 
“track foreign targets.” There’s a huge difference between the two phrases. 
Public outrage was almost entirely based on the idea that the NSA was spying on everyone who uses those services, 
broad, unrestricted access to private information. 
But the revision limits the scope of the operation to *international communications*.

http://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-updates-spying-story-2013-6 

According to The Washington Post. ""PRISM gives the U.S. government access to email, documents, audio, video, 
photographs and other data belonging to foreigners on foreign soil who are under investigation.""

Are you a foreigner on foreign soil who is under investigation?

""It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so."" TRUE!

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jul/08/lynn-westmoreland/phone-call-surveillance-policy-no-mystery-congress/

From YOUR link. [when you read past the hyperbolic headline, down at the bottom, you find this.]

""The top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection.""

Based on [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (assuming it is accurate) he left the US at roughly 2am on 24th June *UK time*, which would have been 6-9pm 23rd June *US time*. Direct commercial flights take 6-8 hours, so depending on how he travelled, he might have arrived in the UK just on 23rd June in the western parts of the US.

At a guess, President Trump's press office said he'd be flying to Scotland on Thursday 23rd (which is true), and that got repeated by the UK press by without checking for time zones, and also got turned from ""leaving on 23rd"" to ""arriving on 23rd"" by mistake.",comment

Talking of sources, based on [this article](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/general-election/timeline-how-referendum-night-unfolded-1-7980730) Farage claimed victory at 4am, Galloway at roughly 2.35am, with projections of a Leave win beginning around 12.30am. The BBC and ITV called the election at roughly 4.40am. All of which would have been while President Trump was on the plane.

Secondly, let's look at what he actually said, based on [this transcript](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/full-text-theresa-may-trump-visit-transcript-718569):

&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.

So it doesn't matter if he flew into the UK on 23rd (he didn't), or if technically the result hadn't been called when he arrived (it had been), because his claim was about opening the course the day before.

So even if we take ""Brexit"" to be on 24th June (rather than the day of the vote) he was still wrong. He got his events in the wrong order.",comment

&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.

President Trump [left for the UK on Friday 24th June](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday 24th June](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746272130992644096) - around 10am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746273889160957952) around 10.30am.

No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.

The guy couldn't remember basic facts.

-------

Other gems from the press conference. The whole ""fake news"" for reporting what he said thing, saying ""We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before"" - interesting use of ""wealthy"" there.

On meeting with President Putin:

&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and it’s just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and I’ll be talking about nuclear proliferation.

On Nato spending:

&gt; I say we pay 90 percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.

He can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/) of [sources](https://www.nato.int/cps/ie/natohq/topics_67655.htm) the US contributes 22% of Nato's common fund, and about 70% of Nato military spending.

On immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:

&gt;  It’s not good for Europe and it’s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We’re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don’t have immigration laws — I don’t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you’re tied in a lawsuit for five years.

On the UK-US special relationship:

&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it’s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough — if they don’t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It’s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.

On Russia invading Ukraine:

&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea — I wouldn’t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We’ll have to see what happens ... I’m not bad at doing things. Let’s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.

On Theresa May:

&gt;  She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.

On the Russia meeting:

&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it’s a dream, but it’s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I’m not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia. People say ‘he loves Russia’ - I love the U.S. I love China and I love other countries.",comment

It's not even an argument against a single market.

Margaret Thatcher herself was pro-single market and went to lengths to spell out what it should be and what it should mean in her 1988 Bruges Speech.

4494,'Queen backs Brexit' - The Sun front page tomorrow,"Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a ""capstone of a United States of Europe"". The Lisbon treaty (an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well) passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme.  

Both here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics. I am sick of the federal question being avoided by these people. No other trade group has a foreign minister and serious proposals for an army, it's a farce to see people pretend this is all about trade, it's a federation.",comment
4495,'Queen backs Brexit' - The Sun front page tomorrow,"&gt; It'll be interesting to see how the Queen reacts, because if she denies backing Brexit it will show that she supports the EU. 

Seems to me like it's just a case of the Sun trying to goad some sort of response out of Buckingham Palace that they can call a statement of support for one side or the other. Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this:

&gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. 

It all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its ""highly reliable source"". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing.

&gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims.""

Seems entirely reasonable.

The Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should ""think very carefully"", that means that 

&gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. 

and that therefore

&gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don’t voters have a right to know what it is?

However, these conventions are also not able to stand in a court or enforceable in anyway essentially acting as agreements.

There are many things to criticise Clegg for but attacking him because someone who wasn't even an MEP until 2009 (Clegg stood down as an MEP in 2004), who now leads the political group that didn't exist until after Clegg left the European Parliament (and which formed out of a merger of the group Clegg was part of and another group), is an EU Federalist, is a bit of a stretch.",comment
4526,'Queen backs Brexit' - The Sun front page tomorrow,"&gt; Who do I believe, The Sun or Nick Clegg?

Most likely somewhere in between. Reading between the lines I imagine a conversation did happen at some lunch where she said something negative about the EU to Nick Clegg.

After the lunch someone else at the table (possibly a senior Conservative figure?) probably told the story on to one of their colleagues, perhaps over-dramatising it a bit, as a little jab at Clegg (along the lines of ""the Queen had a rant at him over the EU, it was a bit surprising"").

That person (if I had to guess, probably someone close to Boris Johnson, if not him) is now supporting ""Leave"" and has therefore leaked what they remembered of it to someone at The Sun (directly or indirectly), who in turn have put their own spin on things.

So Clegg probably can't deny it completely as the conversation may have happened - but the Sun's spin (that she supports Brexit and that she 'let rip' at him and so on) may be ""nonsense"" and didn't happen.

But that's all speculation...",comment

4532,'Queen backs Brexit' - The Sun front page tomorrow,"Funnily enough, I'm writing about consequences that are certainties at the moment. While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences, these are purely things that will happen. Copying and pasting ruins the formatting, so here's a short sample:

- The UK will leave all EU treaties after 2 years from a “No” vote unless. For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if:
- A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement.
- All 27 remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this.
- Trade deals alone take 5-10 years or more. Negotiating anything beyond this (such as EEA membership or similar) would take a similar amount of time. More complex deals would logically take longer.
- While these timescales cannot be “known”, a faster negotiation would be record-breaking. 
- Britain hasn’t negotiated a trade deal for 40 years. We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases.
- A shorter example is that of the EEA; it took from 1989 to 1994
- 12.6% of UK GDP is linked to exports to the EU, while only 3.1% of other EU member states GDP is linked to exports to the UK. Any proposition that that “they need us more than we need them” and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesn’t hold up.
- The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership. This entails:
- Large membership fees
- Freedom of movement
- Following a vast majority of the laws
- All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place, so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation.

4563,'Queen backs Brexit' - The Sun front page tomorrow,"So I understand the appeal of a unified europe, even to the extent of a federal entity with current nations as states. But what do you feel about the direction that this is going with regard to things like the lack of accountability in elections?

For example the US are having a big debate at the moment to decide their new leader. There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that. We're just told Junker is the president as voted for by the leaders of each nation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission#Appointment

Well why should I trust Cameron to pick the right person? Also why do leaders of nations with a population of a few million get the same say as leaders of nations with a population of over 50 million?

Surely something as important as who our president is should be something that the entirety of the EU population should get a say in? And this is something that should have bene built in right at the start, not something that we are aspirationally moving towards.

Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president.

In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party.

Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more.

In fairness I wish this was the way all corporate lobbying operated.

Petition your employees who then petition government and vote in their own interests (while taking on board the company's views).

---

Corporate political donations could work in a similar way.    

The amount of money a company was planning on donating gets divided up and each employee gets a 'campaign voucher' that they are free to give to any political party of their choosing. 

The company then petitions their employees on who they'd prefer the donations go to, why that party is better for the company and its employees, etc. And how the policies of that party will enable the company to grow, wages to rise, etc.

Ultimately though the donations would be made anonymously by employees entirely at their own discretion after weighing their employer's arguments against their own views.

4656,Debunk this: The '97% consensus' of scientists on climate change is complete bunk... fraudulent statistic repeated everywhere is based on blatant scientific FRAUD,"Lol natural news.

On a serious note, even if the 97% consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not.

Edit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:

Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.

The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying ""something causes itself"". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.

Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.

I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.

4657,Debunk this: The '97% consensus' of scientists on climate change is complete bunk... fraudulent statistic repeated everywhere is based on blatant scientific FRAUD,"This is the entire problem with using bandwagon fallacies as an argument for something. You end up arguing things that really shouldn't matter - it doesn't matter whether 2, 50 or 97% of scientists ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming"" - and arguing the percentage is a waste of time. If they want to argue against man made climate change they need to provide evidence that the climate isn't changing due to man's actions.

Still - here we are.

First thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of 489 randomly selected scientists, the 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at 11,944 abstracts - I believe there have been others. The site seems to ignore these.

The other things that jump out at me are.

&gt; the researchers then selected 79 of their sample and declared them “experts.""

Well no the researchers did not do that, those surveyed did - by publishing papers on climate change - it shouldn't be a surprise that out of 3,146 scientists only 79 of them were climate scientists... It's a poor way to decide if man made climate change is correct or not - but I don't think the poll claims that it is.

&gt; So if I send out an email survey to 1000 people, and then I hand-pick the 75 responses I like the best, then can I proclaim those results to be ""settled science"" too? Will Al Gore champion my cause and demand billions in reparations from first world nations on my behalf?

No because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.

So sure, if we ignore all other surveys that confirm the statistic - then this alone as a support for anthropomorphic climate change is weak, usefully there are other things supporting man made climate change other than one email poll.",comment

4660,Debunk this: The '97% consensus' of scientists on climate change is complete bunk... fraudulent statistic repeated everywhere is based on blatant scientific FRAUD,"The linked article does have an element of truth in it, in that the statistic is often stated incorrectly. The [Doran (2009) study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/eost2009EO03/epdf) found that 97% of those respondents with the greatest level of expertise in climate science agreed that ""human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures.""  The NaturalNews article seems to suggest that these respondents were cherry-picked to produce the desired result, but they represented those ""who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change."" This is naturally going to be a much smaller subset of scientists, but it includes those whose knowledge and expertise is arguably most relevant.

This result is often shorthanded in public discourse to ""97% of scientists agree,"" but that's not an issue of scientific fraud.  The scientists explained it fully in their publication.

It's also relevant (but not addressed in the NaturalNews article) that several independent studies have been done using different methods, and reached very similar conclusions. [This skepticalscience.com article](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm) provides a good overview.

Another important thing to note is that we can tell the difference between carbon sources based on the amount of C14 isotopes they have. Since C14 is made in the atmosphere and likes to decay, things that are alive have proportions of C14 to C12 in line with the atmosphere, with some notable exceptions. Things that are dead lose their C14 as it decays to the more stable C12. Since the stuff we're concerned about is ""fossil fuel"", fuel derived from the remains of long-dead life forms, it has no remaining C14. We can check the proportion of our atmosphere composed of C14 to C12 and tell that the vast majority of added carbon in the CO2 is C12. The only other real source of massive amounts of C12 being pumped into the atmosphere is volcanoes, and we know how much CO2 they're pumping out. It's much less than the increase of CO2 we're experiencing, doesn't explain the increase.",comment

Radiation itself can not persist on objects for long periods of time, only radio emitters such as uranium, which can give a steady stream of radiation pose any risk whatsoever (rest assured your microwave does not contain uranium)

*Answer*, however, is not a borrowed word, but an English word which was introduced to the English lexicon from the Proto-Germanic language. This is because English developed with influence from the Germanic people coming to England hundreds of years ago, notably the Frisians, Saxons, and Danes. When they went to England, whether trading or settling, the English language evolved to accommodate. 

So now you see what I mean? There is German influence from pre-Old English that have Germanic origins from hundreds of years ago, and there are German words that English borrowed very recently without changing or integrating the word.

4770,"Debunk this: Nicotine isn't really bad for you, and it's the other substances that makes tobacco so harmful.","Actually, he is right, kind of.  Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively.  Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use.  It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes.  

Is nicotine good for you?  No, its not.  It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems.  However, caffeine and ethanol are both ""not good"" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects.  It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the ""worst"" thing in a cig.

Just to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it.

&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK — Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.

Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction


Also, wikipedia has alot of this information.

Now, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe.  This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent.  This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe.  They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient.  My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.",support

Not much you can cut corners on and still get decent ""smoke."" Propylene glycol has a pretty good body of research saying it's harmless in the quantities you could possibly be smoking, it's used for medical vaporizers. Vegetable glycerin I'm admittedly not so sure of, but so far as I know there's no known issues caused by vaporizing it. I suppose the various flavorings added could theoretically cause issues, it's hard to say exactly what they're made of. That said, I'd put a good amount of money on most people having zero or negligible health impact from the non-nicotine components of e-cig juice.

Turnout varies enormously by social grade, with 72% turnout from those in grade AB and 57% turnout from those in DE.  AB voters lean Conservative (45% Con, 26% Lab) and DE voters lean Labour (27% Con, 41% Lab).  Both groups account for roughly 25% of the population.

So it's entirely possible that if you accounted for differential turnout according to both age and social class, you'd get a different result, and find that uniform turnout would have changed the results (ie voters represented a skewed sample of the electorate).

Please advise.","Assuming that this article is correct and that cancer is caused by the *candida* fungus, the number of fallacious arguments proposed by Icke is numerous but should be considered not surprising considering his other beliefs and ""support"" he brings up for them. From the unsubstantiated claims throughout the article, to pathetically weak appeals to authority and complete misunderstandings of Tullio Simoncini's research, and oncology, its fairly obvious that Icke is merely trying to stir up trouble where non need be stirred up.",comment
4855,Is it true there has never been a war between two democracies? Yes! Israel's no longer democracy.,"False.  The first step in one democracy declaring war on another is to carefully define democracy in such a way that it excludes your opponent.

In this instance, you have chosen to define Israel as not a democracy.",deny

Israel has the chance to be a beacon of democracy in the middle east and/or a stable homeland for the Jewish people, but actions like this don't help either endeavor.",comment
4857,Is it true there has never been a war between two democracies? Yes! Israel's no longer democracy.,"Israel never really was a democracy. 

The government was formed as a quasi-democratic socialist (Zionist) entity by the leaders of various factions, unions, military, etc -- and for decades leaders have always been selected from that small group: Ben Gurion (from the Hagana/Histadrut), Menachem Begin (from the Irgun), Ariel Sharon (military), etc.",support

4859,[Debunk this]Carl Sagan settled an argument between Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke about how aliens should look in their film 2001,I don't see a conflict here. Both can be true. SK worked on an alien concept and took Sagan's advice. Also there is an alien star baby in the end.,comment
4860,[Debunk this]Carl Sagan settled an argument between Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke about how aliens should look in their film 2001,"Frewin says

&gt; SK was exploring ideas for the aliens later in 1965 and through 1966  ... None of this would have been done had SK followed Sagan's advice.

The baby at the end is not an alien.  David Bowman is an old man at the end and then becomes the baby.

They are not mutually exclusive positions. Kubrick worked on alien concepts and also considered Carl Sagan's recommendation not to show them.

The idea that none of this would have been done if Kubrick followed Sagan's is false. He could still have gone ahead and looked at possible aliens but eventually agreed with Sagan's view.",query

I have no idea where you got that.

Batman, you bullshitted us on the Susan Blackmore thread.  You still haven't answered my question there:

&gt;I said, **at what point in the video (minutes:seconds)** does an expert say the sequence has been replicated?

I don't have time for this.

The positions are not mutually exclusive. As for the other thread. Susan Blackmore can claim all she wants that OBE's haven't been replicated. They have been. Straussman's DMT experiments did exactly that.

I certainly don't think you debunked Sagan here at all.",comment
